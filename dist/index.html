The sky was clear, and the stars shone brightly, beckoning her to explore. She packed a small backpack with snacks, a blanket, and her trusty telescope.</p><p class="content-ps parg2">Lily set off on her bike, riding through the quiet streets of her small town. She pedaled until she reached an open field, far away from the city lights, where she could truly appreciate the beauty of the night sky.</p><p class="content-ps parg3">As she lay on her blanket, gazing at the stars, she noticed a shooting star streaking across the sky. Excitement surged through her, and in that moment, she made a wish for an unforgettable night.</p><p class="content-ps parg4">Suddenly, a soft glow illuminated the surroundings. To her astonishment, a portal opened in front of her. Curiosity tingling, Lily stepped through, finding herself in a different world altogether. The sky was filled with colors she had never seen before, and the air felt crisp and pure.</p><p class="content-ps parg5">She ventured further into this new land, encountering friendly creatures made of stardust. They guided her through sparkling forests and shimmering lakes, sharing stories of constellations and the secrets of the universe.</p><p class="content-ps parg6">Lily couldn't believe her luck – her wish for adventure had come true. Hours flew by as Lily immersed herself in the wonders of this celestial realm. Finally, the time came to bid farewell.</p><p class="content-ps parg7">With a heavy heart, she returned through the portal, back to her familiar field under the stars. As Lily lay on her blanket once more, she realized that the warmth she had felt that night wasn't just from the weather—it was the warmth of possibility, of discovery, and of the limitless beauty the universe holds.</p><p class="content-ps parg8">From that night on, every warm December evening held a promise of adventure and the magic of the stars.</p><p class="parg9">In a 3D world, capabilities are limitless that it turns demanding for perfectionism, that is why I have just published this project out not as a masterpiece, yet a good one. For now, that should be enough for this experiment. In case you care about the credits, check the right panel. I, <a href="https://github.com/alkebsi" target="_blank">MKebsi</a>, have made this project and I am happy you are here and I hope you enjoyed your visit. After all, thanks for dropping by!</p></article></main><footer id="credits"><div id="credits-x-con"><button id="credits-x">X</button></div><!-- #credits-x --><div id="credits-con"><h2 id="credits-caption">Credits</h2><p class="credit-line credits-intro">This work was made out of love and some passion to practice, by <a href="https://github.com/alkebsi" class="credit-line-tag">MKebsi.</a></p><p class="credit-line credits-intro">As it felt daunting to work hours on an unplanned piece, the final result was kind of satisfying, yet needs more work! That is the world of programming in general. Programming projects are not, and will never, be perfect; however, keeping it as good as possible is usually the ultimate goal.</p><p class="credit-line credits-intro">As I have been working on this project for hours, I was not going to be able to do all by myself. So, I want to thank everyone who was involved in the creation of this project, <span class="credit-line-tag">especially my guide in the journey, my motivational assistance, and my best friend, my OBro!</span></p><p class="credit-line"><span class="credit-line-tag">Models:</span> The car model was created by <a href="https://sketchfab.com/borcore">Boring Korotkov</a> @Sketchfab.com. Every other model in the scene was created by MKebsi using Blender v3.6 without the use of any additional plugin or addon.</p><p class="credit-line"><span class="credit-line-tag">Content:</span> The content is an AI generated story using <a href="https://www.writecream.com/ai-story-generator-free-no-sign-up/">WriteCream.com</a> where the topic was as simple as “A warm night in the middle of December.” Hitting the “Advanced” button, you will see some additional settings. I made it “Simplest” and set the word count to “2000”; however, the generated content was less than 300 words.</p><p class="credit-line"><span class="credit-line-tag">Images:</span> Surprisingly, this is project has only one set of images – the cube map taken from Three.js examples. I don't exactly know the source, but I have taken it from <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/dev/examples/textures/cube/MilkyWay">three/examples/textures/cube/MilkyWay/*.jpg</a></p><p class="credit-line"><span class="credit-line-tag">Fonts:</span> The main font used for this project is the "Mona Sans" font created by the amazing team @GitHub. It is widely customizable that I needed nothing else!</p><p class="credit-line"><span class="credit-line-tag">Programming Libraries:</span> I used a lot of JavaScript libraries to assist me on the creation of this piece. So, below is the list of libraries I used the most!</p><ul id="credits-unordered-list"><li class="credits-list-item"><span class="credit-line-tag">Three.js:</span> A WebGL library (the main one in this project),</li><li class="credits-list-item"><span class="credit-line-tag">Cannon.js:</span> A 3D physics library (Note: I have been using the npm offline and haven’t been able to redownload it using “npm install cannon”),</li><li class="credits-list-item"><span class="credit-line-tag">GSAP: </span>JavaScript based animations library + GSAP ScrollTrigger built-in plugin,</li><li class="credits-list-item"><span class="credit-line-tag">Webpack.js:</span> A JavaScript bundling library for cleaner and reusable code structure + some dev libraries and/or dependencies,</li><li class="credits-list-item"><span class="credit-line-tag">Dat.GUI:</span> A WebGUI library for visual, on browser data testing (you can see it on the top right corner once adding “#tests” to the URL and reloading this page), and lastly</li><li class="credits-list-item"><span class="credit-line-tag">Stats.js:</span> A framerate tracking library (you can see it on the left top corner once testing).</li></ul><p class="credit-line">Not to forget, I have edited some of the shader and the code structure of the grass which was initially made by <a href="https://github.com/James-Smyth">James Smyth</a> who has generously published <a href="https://github.com/James-Smyth/three-grass-demo">the source code @GitHub</a> thanks for his kindness!</p></div><!-- #credits-con --></footer></body></html>
